# SwiftStay – Hotel Booking Web App

SwiftStay is a functional hotel booking interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
I developed this project as part of my selection task for **GDG VIT**.  
The goal was to create a smooth, user-friendly experience for finding and managing hotel stays.

## 📂 Project Structure & Modularity
 
The application logic is separated into two  reusable components:

  Handles main logic, state management, filtering, and sorting.

  A dedicated modular component that receives data via **Props** to display the user's active bookings.
